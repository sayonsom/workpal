PRODUCT POSITIONING
-------------------

No new apps. No dashboards. Forward a task, get structured work back — with you in control.

  Turn inbox chaos into structured work.
  Your agent only sees what you forward. You decide what gets sent.

Tagline candidates (pick best fit during build):
  - "Forward the work. Get it done."

  - "Inbox-native AI, with you in control."
