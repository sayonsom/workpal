      {
        "question": "How is this different from just emailing ChatGPT?",
        "answer": "ChatGPT doesn't know who you are. It doesn't know your writing style, your frameworks, or the quality bar you hold yourself to. Workpal builds a persistent profile of how you work — your clone carries that identity into every task. But unlike ChatGPT, each task is completely isolated. No conversation history bleeding between tasks."
      },
      {
        "question": "What do you mean by 'no memory bleed'?",
        "answer": "In ChatGPT or Claude, your previous conversations subtly influence new ones — context accumulates, old instructions linger, outputs drift. With Workpal, every forwarded email spawns a fresh instance of your clone. It knows your style and role (permanent identity), but the task data is completely scoped. Task A never touches Task B."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can it really match my writing style?",
        "answer": "It gets better over time. During onboarding, you provide your LinkedIn, writing samples, and past deliverables. Your clone learns your tone, vocabulary, structure preferences, and depth of analysis. The more you use it, the more it calibrates. You can also give it direct feedback — 'too formal,' 'add more data,' 'this isn't how I'd frame it' — and it adapts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Workpal have access to my inbox?",
        "answer": "No. Zero ambient access. Your clone cannot read your inbox, calendar, contacts, or files. It only sees what you explicitly forward to it. One task at a time. This is a deliberate architectural choice — we believe AI agents should operate on a need-to-know basis."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens to my data after a task is done?",
        "answer": "Task-specific data (the email you forwarded, attachments, the clone's output) is processed and delivered back to you. We don't retain task content beyond delivery. Your permanent profile (role, style, preferences) persists so your clone stays calibrated, but you can delete it at any time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for sensitive client work?",
        "answer": "Yes. All exchanges are TLS encrypted. We never read, store, or train on your content. Enterprise customers get dedicated infrastructure on AWS/Azure/GCP, fully isolated. We're SOC 2 Type II certified and GDPR compliant. If your industry has specific compliance requirements, reach out — we likely already support it or have a pathway."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do you need my LinkedIn to get started?",
        "answer": "Your LinkedIn is the fastest way to teach your clone who you are — your role, industry, skills, experience level. It's a shortcut to calibration. It's not required — you can skip it and manually describe your role instead, or upload writing samples directly. We never post to your LinkedIn or access it after the initial import."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the output isn't good enough to send?",
        "answer": "You always review before anything goes out. Your clone replies only to you — never to your client or boss directly. Think of it as a very capable first draft from someone who knows your standards. You edit, refine, and send when you're satisfied. Over time, the edits get smaller."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I forward emails with attachments?",
        "answer": "Yes. PDFs, slides, spreadsheets, docs — your clone processes them as part of the task context. If someone sends you 10 competitor decks and says 'analyze these,' you forward the whole thread with attachments. Your clone reads everything."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of tasks can it handle?",
        "answer": "Anything you'd delegate to a sharp junior version of yourself: competitive analyses, market research summaries, email drafts, proposal outlines, slide content, data synthesis, meeting prep, client briefs, internal reports. It's strongest on knowledge work that has a clear input and expected output format."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is this priced?",
        "answer": "Free for your first 10 tasks — no credit card, no strings. After that, individual plans start at a monthly subscription. Teams and enterprise get volume pricing with admin controls and dedicated infrastructure. We'll publish pricing publicly soon — or reach out and we'll quote you directly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my company has compliance requirements?",
        "answer": "We built for this. SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, HIPAA-ready for healthcare, FedRAMP pathway for government. Enterprise deployments run on private cloud infrastructure. We can sign BAAs, DPAs, and custom security agreements. Email security@workpal.email."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will my colleagues see what I forward or what my clone produces?",
        "answer": "No. Your clone is yours. It replies only to your email address. No one — not your boss, not your IT admin, not Workpal staff — can see your tasks or outputs unless you explicitly share them. On enterprise plans, admins see metadata (usage stats, volume) but never content."
      },
      {
        "question": "What stops this from becoming another abandoned AI tool?",
        "answer": "Most AI tools fail because they require people to change how they work — learn a new interface, write prompts, switch tabs. Workpal lives in your inbox. The workflow is: forward, get work back. That's it. The adoption barrier is essentially zero, which is why retention is fundamentally different from dashboard-based AI tools."
